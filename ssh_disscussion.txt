ssh keys are special keys that help keep the communication with GitHub safe. Instead of using passwords, these keys use a pair of secret codes, one we keep to ourselves as users, itâ€™s like a private key and one you share with GitHub a public key. This makes it much harder for others to guess or steal your access. SSH keys are primarily associated with secure shell access and version control systems, providing secure user authentication and encrypted communication.On the other hand HTTP keys, such as API keys, are commonly used for authentication in web-based applications, allowing secure access to web services through the HTTP protocol.
